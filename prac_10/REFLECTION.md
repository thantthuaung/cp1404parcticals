# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

At first, I found that my estimates were a bit off, especially when it came to tasks that involved debugging or reviewing code. I tended to underestimate how long it would take to resolve small issues or test thoroughly.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I worked through more practical tasks, I became better at estimating how long each task would take. I started factoring in time for testing, debugging, and refining my code. Over time, my estimates became more realistic because I knew what to expect and could break tasks into smaller, manageable parts.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that it’s important to be flexible with time estimates and leave some room for unexpected challenges. Tasks like debugging often take longer than expected, so it's better to overestimate a bit rather than under. I also realized that breaking down tasks makes it easier to estimate more accurately because I could focus on one step at a time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others has been a great learning experience. It’s helped me see things from different perspectives, especially when it comes to areas I might have overlooked. I've realized how important it is to write clear and readable code that others can easily understand. Feedback has also shown me where I can improve, whether it's simplifying my approach or fixing small errors that I might have missed. Overall, it's made me more open to constructive criticism and has pushed me to constantly improve my work.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Through reviewing other people’s code, I’ve learned how valuable it is to break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks before tackling a project. I’ve also realized the importance of keeping code organized, especially when it comes to functions and structures. This approach not only improves clarity but also makes the entire project easier to handle in the long run.



### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/St3v3n1320/cp1404practicals/pull/1#issuecomment-2424900883]()

### Explanation

In this review, I focused on how the functions were structured. I pointed out where certain tasks could be broken down into smaller functions, which made the overall flow of the code clearer. This helped the author think about the project as a series of manageable tasks rather than one big block of work.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/Sebered/cp1404practicals/pull/3#event-15240115533]()

### Explanation

Here, I paid attention to the overall structure and readability of the code. I suggested a few changes to make the code cleaner and easier to follow. By improving the organization and modularity of the code, the review helped the project become more streamlined and easier to work with in the future.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge, I would definitely focus more on emphasizing the importance of using functions and methods, as the teacher suggested. It really helps with organizing code, and it’s a practice that makes the project much easier to manage.


### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I did a good job of committing and pushing my work after completing each task. This made it easy to track my progress and keep everything organized, especially when collaborating with others.
